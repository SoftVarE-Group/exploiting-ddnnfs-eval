# Empirical Evaluation on Exploitation of d-DNNFs
Replication package for FSE'22 evaluation of "Exploiting d-DNNFs for Counting-based Analysis of Feature Models"

## How to build

The python benchmark script can be used as it comes.
Furthermore, some solvers are not included in this repository due to licensing issues. 
In `solvers/` the tools are provided either as built binaries, source code, or links to respective repositories.

## How to run

For both ways you have to specify a run configuration (.json or .yaml) file or a folder that contains
one or multiple run configurations

### Run benchmark via Docker
TODO provide an image

You can run a container by building your own image from the Dockerfile.
Values in capital letters have to be replaced with individual values.

Build the image
```
docker build -t benchmark:TAG PATH_TO_THE_DOCKERFILE
```

Run a container with a run configuration (in the following example all files in the exps directory)
```
docker run --name CONTAINER_NAME -it benchmark:TAG run_configurations/exps/
```

Get the result data
```
docker cp CONTAINER_NAME:benchmark/results DEST_PATH_ON_HOST
```

### Alternative Run benchmark
In general, an experiment specified by a .json or a .yaml file can be executed with

```
python3 run.py run_configurations/experiment.yaml
```
